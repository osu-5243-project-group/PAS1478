19-JUN-1987 05:50:22.49;None;None;None;None;SRI LANKA PLANS TO RENEW ABU DHABI OIL CONTRACT;    COLOMBO, June 19 - ;Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided
to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000
tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters.
    They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is
now awaiting its approval.
    CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31
this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1
at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in
the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three
parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC officials also said the company agreed with the
Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of
Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the
government selling price.
    Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through
C.Itoh.
    Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light
from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several
constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels
and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.
    Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where
lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC
then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for
delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to
offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.
    CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since
December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln
tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot
market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.

real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this
year and the economy should achieve the government's target of
three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.
    The South African central bank said in its quarterly
bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January
to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the
nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement
in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.
    It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the
third and fourth quarters of last year.
    It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement
reached with international creditors in March as evidence of
improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.
    The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most
repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term
foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.
    South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised
surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of
7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus
of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth
consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.

campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing
domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources
said.
    Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this
summer, starting with <Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.
    Showa Shell Sekiyu KK <SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell
98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.
    Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a
higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted
other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.
    "We have received a good response from consumers of Formula
Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel
consumption," Showa Shell said.
    Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher
than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share
of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.
    High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total
gasoline sales in Japan, it added.
    Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct
of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately
after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.
    Nippon Oil Co Ltd <NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100
octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high
octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline
sales.
    The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share
has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift
gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station
construction in the next two to three years.
    "Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline
sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline
production quotas," an official at a major oil company said.
    An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government
press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including
the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil
companies increase their international competitiveness.
    Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil,
Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the
production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.
    Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct
from the previous year, according to a MITI report.

19-JUN-1987 08:25:46.43;None;None;None;None;TRACOMIN SEES LOWER U.S. EDIBLE GROUNDNUT EXPORTS;    LAUSANNE, Switzerland, June 19 - ;U.S. Exports of edible
groundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to
September 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading
company Tracomin SA said.
    It revised its December 1986 forecast that exports would
total 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of U.S.
Market share in the two main importing countries, Britain and
the Netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at a
premium in the U.S. Domestic market.
    Tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop
at 215,000 tonnes compared with 264,000 the previous year.
    Tracomin said it expects a good 1987 U.S. Groundnut crop
and forecast a resurgence in U.S. Exports next year.
    "Barring any market manipulations, a good U.S. Harvest in
1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the
reappearance of the U.S.A as the world's leading producer of
peanuts," it said.
    Overall exports from China, the leading exporter last year,
will remain at exceptionally high levels this year despite
quality complaints and difficulties in implementing some
earlier high-priced contracts. It is too early to say if China
can retain its current market share in 1988, Tracomin said.

Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
    Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
    Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.

    Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
organisation decided to cut production again from last
September onwards.
    Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
    Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
official Saudi Press Agency.
    The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.

    Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
report said.
    The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced
around 750,000 bpd last year.

    Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes
per day, the report said.
    Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4
billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

agreement may only need a slight review.
    "I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,"
Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here
ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which
starts June 25.
    "We already have an agreement which may need only a slight
review," Lukman said.
    The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers
in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at
15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18
dlrs a barrel.
    Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to
just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts
firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement
to keep the market stable.
    "I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to
strengthen the gains we have made so far," Lukman said.
    He declined to say if the current ceiling should be
maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and
18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.
    "Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our
collective will to keep the market strong," he said.
    He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks
ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this
was significant for its members.
    Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year
when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a
restocking now for the winter was responsible for current
market strength.

    In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in
Birmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are
more favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than
for a good number of years.
    "It would surely be foolish to put that favourable
conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or
excessively," he said.
    "We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the
risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of
high inflation," he added.
    Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would
argue that interest rates are still too high and deter
investment in industry.
    "But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were
intervening to support sterling and had some temporary
difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in
base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at
the time," he added. Base rate is currently nine pct.

Community open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC
farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade
sources said.
    The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an
agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export
subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the
uncertainty remains.
    One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be
avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation
will become more serious as time passes.
    However, traders said there seem to be few buyers around,
lessening the disruptive impact of the delay.
    Poland and South Korea, who are in the market for feed
wheat, will be offered intervention grain through special
tenders, traders said.

19-JUN-1987 10:46:25.47;None;None;None;None;U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES;    LONDON, June 19 - ;More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers
fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes
the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other
interest rates.
    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in
years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers
trying to lock into cheap money.
    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials
said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home
mortgage business.
    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They
were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a
few years ago.
    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,
mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
induce them to retain their accounts.
    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
    "We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"
said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,
explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
offering variable rate mortgages.
    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
more.
    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for
new business, officials at all three institutions said.
    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
below those on the variable rate loans.
    "Of course they are less profitable than other (variable
rate) mortgages," said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which
earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
new mortgage loans.
    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
loans because, "It was just another way to attract people to our
mortgage product."
    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed
rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was
exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
    "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, noting
that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
of its 1986 volume.
    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
lender is earning an above average return on assets.
    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
the benefit of cheap money.
    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption
that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates
fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.
    Young explained that the company had planned to protect
itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
complicated hedging instrument.
    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He
said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
mortgages and hedge profitably.
    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does
make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This
means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
and selling them to an investor.
    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular
again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
over the past few years.

were not available for comment on market rumors that it is
interested in acquiring Reed International plc <REED.L>.
    Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
adviser, declined comment.
    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said
the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has
announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell."It's completely
inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
drop the recapitalization," he said.
    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a
declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
in light of the recapitalization.
    Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon
Brothers Inc <SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the
case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and
Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
amount, Harcourt said.
    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the
court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
convert prior to June eight.
    An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed
by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors
that Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New
York said "there's no basis to think that it's us."

western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet
growth but plant density is reported to be good in most

    Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has

fields.

boosted sugar beet growth.
    Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet
development, Licht said.
    In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant
population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy
weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are
rated as slightly below normal.
    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with
heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it
was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
impossible.
    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
favourable for beet growth, Licht said.
    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,
it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
    In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall
boosted beet development.
    Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes
between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to
delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where
beets are maturing very early this year.

highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
policy changes from the session.
    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
Gulf.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
highest level since January 1986.
    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
agreement may only need a slight review.
    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
should begin easing.
    "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
to in December because oil prices are firm," said John Hill, a
vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
barrels in the fourth quarter.
    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
reduction in output.
    "And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said Nauman
Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
    "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
committed to stabilizing the market," said Rosario Ilacqua,
analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
producers receive less money for their oil.
    "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"
said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting," he
said.
    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
    "The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
Gulf," said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securites.
    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
    "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," Knuettel said.

Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed
combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning
of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado
due to high costs.
    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic
Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at
the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract
from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized
bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,
compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.
    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project
uneconomical even with government price supports and loan
guarantees, Unocal said.
    The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to
5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.

19-JUN-1987 13:28:13.43;None;None;None;None;PLATINUM DEMAND ESTIMATED 17 PCT HIGHER BY 1991;    LONDON, June 19 - ;Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln
ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln
in 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson
Matthey Plc said.
    Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation
in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in
consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest
single application for platinum.
    Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,
Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released
in London today.
    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further
increase in investment buying and may well be cautious.
    He said South Africa was the most likely source of
additional supplies and will need to increase output by about
500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.
    The capital investment required to produce the additional
output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political
climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.
    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the
1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,
Clark said.
    "The very probability of a growth in demand set against the
massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion
only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to
conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially
underpinned in the medium to long-term," Clark said.

have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee
Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.
    Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee
Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.
    The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
coffee agreement, van Horick said.
    If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
agreement, van Horick said.
    Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
Brazil.
    Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
    "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
leaves it very little to object to," van Horick said.
    "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
reflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formula
builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
everyone."
    Although full implications of the new formula have still to
be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly
higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El
Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.
    Because the proposal provides that future quota
distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
    "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
new quota formula, " van Horick said.
    At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.
    "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
just get an agreement," van Horick added.

producing countries to contribute more money towards research
into new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industries
minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview.
    Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said he
had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive
committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC,
to draw up a paper on the matter.
    Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.
    He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals
for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be
defeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.
    Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was
adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,
they would be compensated through access to the EC for
alternative exports.
    "Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot
see how this would work out in our case," Lim said.
    Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250
mln dlrs a year.
    The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC
meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.
    "Not enough research and development effort has been put in
by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes
such as aluminium, paper and plastics," Lim said.
    He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an
exciting possible new application.
    Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money
which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the
new paper was produced.
    He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental
barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International
Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord
into some EC languages are still being awaited.
    Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's
behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it
was important there should not be a long "interregnum" between
the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming
into force.
    He described the present accord as a model for commodity
agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and
consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and
control over buffer stock management.

19-JUN-1987 15:08:14.55;None;None;None;None;LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS;    WASHINGTON, June 19 - ;A group of Latin American and
Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added "the region should
not be the one affected by the trade bills."
    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
and the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by a
trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."
    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
annual trade surpluses with the United States.
    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
    The European Community has also opposed the bills.
    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
    He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
on the Senate floor, expected next week.
    Rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continue
development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
by trade legislation."
    Rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -
especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
national development progress."
    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
termed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effort
to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
legislation.
    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
said as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind."

responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on
coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian
efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.
    Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just
back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing
countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be
agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.
    "There is one country which evidently still does not,"
Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has
been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.
    Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook
for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September
International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.
    He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical
discussions with Colombian officials.
    While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the
Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,
Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said.
    The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month
which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula
for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns
with the technical details of the Colombian plan.
    Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment
on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by
European coffee roasters and traders.
    Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick
said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving
averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for
the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.
    The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas
unless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in the
coffee market are used to set export limits.

discussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers to
transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of
its own vessels under American flags.
    State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the
disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United
States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement
with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in
the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan
administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its
plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.
    The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian
attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic
waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw
the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
    "The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering
U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration," Oakley
said. She emphasized, however, that "if some charter arrangement
could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging
arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis."
    In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy
escort in the Gulf, she said.

   The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator
of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached
an American shipping company about the possibility of a
charter.
    Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives
of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered
vessels flying the U.S. flag "would be protected," the newspaper
reported.
    Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said "we are moving forward
in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security
cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations."

formerly associated with London investor Christopher Moran in
his unsuccessful bid to take over Zondervan Corp last year,
said it cut its stake in the company to less than five pct.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group, led by investors Lawrence Altschul and James
Apostolakis, said it cut its Zondervan stake to 157,500 shares,
or 3.8 pct of the total, from 246,500 shares, or 5.9 pct.
    The group, which earlier this month said in an SEC filing
it wanted join with other groups to maximize share values, said
it sold 89,000 shares between June 9 and 15 for 1.5 mln dlrs.
    The group had joined with the Moran group, which last year
assembled a combined 44 pct stake in Zondervan during its
unsuccessful takeover try.
    Last month, the Moran group broke up and splintered into
various factions. Moran himself withdrew from the takeover
effort and last reported his personal stake at 4.8 pct.

a 10.6 pct stake, and another one led by Minneapolis
stockbroker Jeffrey Wendel with 2.6 pct, have both made recent
SEC filings saying they are seeking agreements with other
parties who may want to seek control of the company.

19-JUN-1987 16:37:13.51;None;None;None;None;NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA;    WASHINGTON, June 19 - ;President Reagan's nominee as top
policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
globalization of financial markets.
    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday
to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed
John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.
    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its
investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.
    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
wrongdoing.
    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after
Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock
speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
profits after being charged with insider trading.
    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have
combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
volatility to some U.S. securities markets.
    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some
lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.
    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign
exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
for an international securities marketplace in which trading
occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce
U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial
disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
review of hostile corporate takeovers.
    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton
investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to
the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
    In line with the views of other top administration
officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
battles over new federal regulations.
    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider
trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.
    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
    The agency is one of the few in the government that
actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
few years because of fees it charges public companies,
investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
for policy differences alone.
    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
each year instead of leaving this to the White House.
    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins
to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
market manipulations by large investment firms.
    The agency requires public companies and investment
vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on
their financial condition and to disclose changes in their
condition any time they issue new securities.
    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to
register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and
it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.
    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial
magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to
become the nation's 35th president.
    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served
from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in
1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's
first term and was Reagan's director of the Central
Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it
into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more
accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when
the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.
    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is
called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet
the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they
should pay about the same rates of duties.
    Yeutter said, "American exporters will find it far easier to
deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of
differing systems which they now face."
    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational
negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.
    Yeutter said government and business moves are based on
data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve
knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.
    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under
the new system, with about half expected to join the system by
January 1988.

Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,
said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be
attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign
securities.
    Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's
overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's
2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree
abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign
securities purchases.
   "The deficit can be better attributed to premature and
delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)
rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment," Sarcinelli
said in a statement.
    Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by
the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said
it had been partly caused by "non-banking capital outflows."
    "In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow
of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our
borders," said the newspaper.
    But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to
say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase
deposits had affected Italy's balance of payments.

Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport
natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, FERC.
    In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport
company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also
transport its own gas to customers.
    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co <T> rejected the FERC
guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the
regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for
gas it has bought but could not sell.
    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay
contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term
contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as
customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.
    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that
Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to
open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.
    But Tenneco today said open access "is one of the steps
FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC
is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even
before all transitional problems are solved."
    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure
under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure
for Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from
Louisiana and Texas up to New England.
    "We remain convinced that the most critical transitional
issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by
FERC in the near future.
    "A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the
industry's continued ability to provide its customers with
reliable natural gas," said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co
president R.C. Thomas.

19-JUN-1987 18:33:18.89;None;None;None;None;U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS;    WASHINGTON, June 19 - ;The economy faces lackluster growth
and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement
in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.
    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness
in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further
hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.
    "These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength
to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?" said Lyle
Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.
    The Commerce Department said this week that the economy
grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but
a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.
    Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending
rose a weak 0.1 per cent.
    "Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --
are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "
Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,
told Reuters.
    Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow
because inflation is rising faster than real wages.
    To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,
returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost
personal income and consumption, he says.
    "I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to
keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"
Gramley said.
    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters
that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the
result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last
and said the recovery was showing anemia.
    Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, "The pace
of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into
monetary policy" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be
accommodative.
    Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct
forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if
the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add
to the risk of a recession.
    Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May
came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an
inventory overhang still exists.
    He says the boost in production came from smaller
industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have
improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.
    "They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in
economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a
recession," Mauro said.
    In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl
Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the
trade deficit will continue to improve.
    "Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and
into 1988 are still quite favorable," he said.
    But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in
inflation.
    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5
to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after
a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.
    The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil
and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.
    "The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets
out of the bottle, it continues to persist," he said, adding he
would like the Fed to tighten credit.
    A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the
dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says
a prominent international banker.
    Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National
Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and
the mark will continue for years because the United States is

19-JUN-1987 18:54:11.35;None;None;None;None;UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES;    CHICAGO, June 19 - ;The six basis point rise of the past
month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a
series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
dollar holds firm.
    "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
points over the last month, largely over indications that
inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms," Samuel Kahan, chief
financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities, said.
    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the
longer term.
    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer
Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
1.5 pct, respectively.
    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money
supply announced this week was "surprising, much larger than
expected," according to Kahan. "Unless quickly reversed," such
a trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"
Kahan said.
    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which
Kahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board
annual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economic
weakness down the road, he said.
    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for
further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
analysts said.
    September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May
18," Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September
bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
in mid-June, Duggan said.
    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted
above the 93 level.
    "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
market," Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst
Brian Singer said.
    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.
currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
    "The critical variable remaining in the market is the value
of the dollar," Kahan said.
    Additional influences next week will be possible
developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact
and size of the U.S. budget deficit, "although these will not
be in the forefront of the market early next week," Kahan said.
    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding
auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results
with little excitement. However, a successful auction could
prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
psychology.

of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
(bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
    They said market respect for the cartel has increased since
it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.
    "There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured
there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
effect putting pressure on end-users," a European crude oil
trader said.
    In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, "There's no reason to expect
a weak market from now on."
    A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, "We
thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
production so the market will react very bullishly."
    Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a
slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark
crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
    August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.
    Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu
Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders
said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.
    They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.
    They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected
and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
requirements before October.
    Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.
    "There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high," said an
international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less
bullish, "For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
how much they (OPEC members) cheat."
    A Singapore trade source said, "There is enough cheating and
leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is
no need to worry about shortages."
    Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,
after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
factor to be considered.
    Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.
    Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in
thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates
quiet on minimal buying interest.
    Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and
tight prompt supplies, dealers said.

29-JUN-1987 03:25:40.09;None;opec;None;None;FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY;    TOKYO, June 29 - ;OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6
mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
    "Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
official price will be 20 dlrs in January," a Japanese refiner
said.
    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
U.K. Brent, traders said.
    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
    "With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
grades further," said a Japanese oil trader.
    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
market has further upward potential in the short term, having
risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
    "You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today," said
one international oil trader in Tokyo.
    "But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
back up again pretty quickly," he added.
    One oil industry analyst concurred, "There is no reason to
expect a weak market from now on." He said he expected OPEC to
raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
maintain steady prices.
    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
too high too fast.
    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
barrels. "Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
too much," an oil industry analyst said.

state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
    They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
    Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
post permanently.
    The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
market.
    The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
    Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
last December.
    Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
does business, the sources said.
    The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister
Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the

29-JUN-1987 04:00:12.83;None;opec;None;None;NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY;    OSLO, June 29 - ;Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in
planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15
until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle
told Reuters.
    "We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,"
he said. "The accord reached there means stability in the oil
market and we shall continue making our contribution."
    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
quarter.
    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
within its December accord on output and prices.
    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
on the latest oil production cutbacks.
    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
prices stable.
    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
during the first half of 1986.
    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
deficit.
     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

today to show its determination to maintain an easy money
policy, central bank officials said.
    "Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an
announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of
the fact that we have not changed our policy stance," a senior
central bank official told Reuters.
    The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month
commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the

    The central bank was concerned about growing market
expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part
responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,
the officials said.
    But money traders said the market generally shrugged off
the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far
below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month
CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid
was 3.75 pct, they said.
    The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact
because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.
    The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD
buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's
pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.
    "We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip
any further," a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing
market expectation of higher rates will remain.
    "If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay

Community presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial
oils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm price
package, diplomats said.
    In a discussion document prepared for today's summit
meeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called
"stabilising mechanism" be the subject of "further study and
consultation with the Community's main trading partners."
    The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on
both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine
oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.
    The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at
the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price
talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the
measure.
    Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on
June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are
supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser
extent, Spain.
    Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats

29-JUN-1987 06:16:15.62;None;None;None;None;BANGLADESH'S TRADE GAP TO WIDEN IN 1987/88;    DHAKA, June 28 - ;Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to
widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the
government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
luxury cars.
    The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
    Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes
were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
    The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told
reporters.
    Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy
covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
government were not included in the policy, they added.
    They said the country's total import bill (both commercial
and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
    The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
economy.
    Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
its main export jute, "which will certainly affect our export
earnings" in the coming year.
    Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
in 1986/87, according official figures.
    But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.

signed a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminium
processing plant in China that will export to South Korea,
Australian officials told journalists.
    China has no official direct trade or government ties with
Seoul, while it maintains close links with North Korea.
    China International Trust and Investment Corporation
(CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in <Bohai Aluminium
Industries Ltd>, the company to build the rolling mill and
extrusion plant on the northeast China coast, they said.
    It was China's largest joint venture so far, they said.
    "A joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating
markets that would not otherwise be possible (for China),"
Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said.
    An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue South
Korean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul is
growing but is not officially publicised.
    Victoria's <Aluvic Ltd>, on behalf of the state government,
will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which is
intended as a sister plant to Victoria's Portland aluminium
smelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in
Portland.
    The China-based joint venture would process Portland
aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic
Chinese market as well as for export, Jolly said.
    The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22
mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint key
managers, he said.
    Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated
by their participation would lead to further CITIC investment
in Victoria. The Chinese group enjoys a high level of
independence from Peking's central government and has extensive
overseas investments.

open market in a bid to ease strong upward pressure on the
currency, which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket
of currencies, dealers said.
    The central bank declined comment, but dealers noted the
bank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on
Friday. The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain
levels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies.
    "They've been in again this morning, selling piecemeal
whenever they think necessary," a senior dealer at an Oslo bank,
who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
    The crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket
-- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is
committed to defending.
    A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown.
The limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50.
    The crown has been bolstered by high Norwegian interest
rates, currently around 16 pct in the money market, and better
than expected economic indicators which showed a sharply
reduced foreign trade deficit in May and inflation stabilising
around the current annual rate of 10 pct.

European Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolve
a dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next
month, diplomatic sources said.
    The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an
unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and
dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy
taking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market.
    The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies
of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's
talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S.
    U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has
returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline
for agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a
related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports.
    The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be
reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was
also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC
pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.
    But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a
few days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans
Andriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10.

ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a
two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt
to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission
spokesman said.
    He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain
notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical
nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the
ministers reach an accord.
    The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but
said they would not be the sort of "dynamic" moves which EC Farm
Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the
case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.
    These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of
ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC
sources said.
    Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices
by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources
said.
    EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still
split over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and
marine oils and fats.
    In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for

of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary
inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish
agriculture ministry official told Reuters.
    The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the
request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached
for support.
    Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an
interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: "Denmark will not
accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach
an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC."
    Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns
in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community
totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.
    Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion
that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC
veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.
    But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said
the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC
regulations. "Canadian officials are very concerned about the
trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the
EC and bilaterally," she added.

communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference
here.
    "The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive
results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which
OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18
dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings
distributed into national production levels.
    "The conference noted that all market indicators, including
spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC
crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating
the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement."
    "The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the
second half of the year and decided that in order to secure
continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the
fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third
quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into
the same national production levels as were defined by the
above-mentioned agreement for that quarter."
    "Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a
committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price
evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices
in order to secure price stability around the opec price
structure.
    "Should there be any significant change in market prices,
the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary
meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the
necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the
year, which would secure the desired market stability."
    "The conference reiterated the necessity of member
countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December
1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,
levels.
    "For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a
committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to
member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the
terms of the agreement."

    "Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the
cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside
OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market
stability.
    The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group
of five heads of delegation established by the 77th
(extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to
undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.
    "The conference observed the continued fall in the value of
the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied
and reported to the next meeting of the conference."

    "The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary
general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next
ordinary meeting.
    "The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil
al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year
from October 7, 1987.
    "The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be
convened in Vienna on December 9, 1987."

West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and
that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a
six-month lull.
    Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest
rates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: "We would be
badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.
    "This could, under certain circumstances, release new
inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to
higher interest rates," he added.

    Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past
six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.
    "But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy
finds itself on a course of growth," he said. "I expect this
development to continue in the coming months."
    Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community
trade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.
    "For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by
protectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts," he added. "This
includes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far
as possible. Protectionism is not found only in the U.S."

29-JUN-1987 07:12:17.89;None;None;None;None;KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR;    VIENNA, June 29 - ;OPEC output for the second half of 1987,
including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,
Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.
    Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its
ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter
level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
target.
    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC third
quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"
    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
levels would have on prices.
    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia
and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about
September.
    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War
enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
mln in the second half.
    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has
been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We will
not discuss it. There will not be any change," he said.
    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended
Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
to be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short a
meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said.
    Ali said the problem of price differentials between the
prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly
at the meeting.

    Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. I
would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced
relative to heavy crudes."
    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said
"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do
the work of another minister."
    Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
    OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread
of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.

year, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported.
    It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, who

    Last December, Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987

mln bpd quota set for Iran, its enemy in the nearly
seven-year-old Gulf war.

been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee
production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily
Fraternite Matin reported.
    The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry
conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.
Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if
there is good rainfall in coming weeks.
    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest
in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has
especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin
said.
    Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this
month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,
compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.
    Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture
had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not
need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have
been affected in some regions, it added.
    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast
1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,
which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described
early development of the new main crop as patchy.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year
forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast
due to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated
the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's
4.33 mln bag harvest.
    Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee
crop as "normal."

announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
export earnings for export promotion abroad.
    The move is designed by the government to improve India's
trade deficit.
    Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit
Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
    The scheme replaces current rules which allow different
amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
    RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will
qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
of annual export earnings.
    These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
    RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the
two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
    Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

dividend rights plan in response to Deluxe Check Printers Inc
<DLX> having agreed to sell its 38 pct interest in DataCard to
National Computer Systems Inc <NLCS.O>.
    DataCard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred
stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common
stock. The dividend is designed to deter National Computer or
other potential suitors from preventing DataCard from
evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value,
DataCard said.
   
    National Computer told Reuters June 22 it could make a bid
for DataCard. On June 25 DataCard filed suit in Hennepin County
District Court in Minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct
stake of its stock to National Computer.
    In announcing the rights plan, DataCard said it "is not
designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the
objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of DataCard's
stockholders."
    The rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after
an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
ownership of 44 pct or more of DataCard's common stock.
   
    Once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy
1/500th of a share of DataCard Series A junior participation
preferred Stock for 35 dlrs. Holders other than an acquirer
would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right
becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred
stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of
the rights.
    The rights dividend distribution is payable July 9 to
shareholders of record July 9.

president Elias Zinn have demanded a list of Crazy Eddie Inc
shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger
of the Edison, N.J. electronics retailer.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June
26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie
shareholders "regarding the affairs" of the company.
    Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct
stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more
shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer.
    Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it
would be provided with "certain information" about Crazy Eddie,
it told the SEC.
    Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in
electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales,
proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie
on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the
possible participation of Crazy Eddie management.
    Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet
with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.
    Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and
investment banker.
    In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that
Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility
with the company, plus further declines in the price of its
stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are
"continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to
their investment" in Crazy Eddie stock.
    Depending on its evaluation of the company, including
actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party
bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president
said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell
some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open
market, through private purchases or in connection with a
merger or tender offer.
    According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and
Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie
common shares between May 20 and June 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93
dlrs a share, or a total of about 11.9 mln dlrs.

29-JUN-1987 11:34:19.06;None;None;None;None;CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW;    KUWAIT, June 29 - ;U.S. moves to increase its warships in
and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
    They said the American decision inevitably carries some
risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
    "As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
Gulf could do serious damage," said one western diplomat.
    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
on "soft targets" such as merchant shipping not protected by
American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
by diplomats as low. However, "There is the threat that the
Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
will go for softer targets," one diplomat said.
    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us."
    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
    "But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
territory would be a very serious escalation" likely moving
world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
last Friday "a river of blood" throughout the world in the event
of any U.S. strike against Iran.
    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

Digiorgio contingent upon approval of Digiorgio," according to

a per share price of 20 dlrs in cash, a subordinated note with
a face value of eight dlrs, 14 pct redeemable preferred stock,
and one common share of the post-buyout company.
    The June 25 buyout proposal, which remains open until July
17, also provides that key members of Digiorgio management and
some of its directors would be invited to remain with the firm
and participate in the group acquiring the company.
    The proposal is also subject to a due diligence review,
execution of a merger agreement, arrangement of financing and
receipt of government approvals, all of which Gabelli and Co

29-JUN-1987 12:21:22.94;None;None;None;None;RAINS HELP U.S. WESTERN CORN BELT, MORE SEEN;    CHICAGO, June 29 - ;Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt
brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier
this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome
moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,
according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather
Inc.
    "There is going to be more rain for the next two, three
days," he said. "We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to
above normal moisture this week."
    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern
Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.
    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with
thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.
    "Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a
pretty good rain," Mohler said.
    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking
an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off
19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.
    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is
expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north
later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across
the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as
early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage
in early July, he said.

approved Citicorp's application to purchase through its
subsidiary, Citicorp Savings of Oakland, Calif., some assets
and assume some liabilities of Sears Savings Bank of Glendale,
Calif.
    Citicorp Savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs in

in assets of 50 branch offices of Sears Savings.
    The proposal involved less than one third of the assets and
liabilities of Sears Savings, owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co
<S>.
    The Fed said that it generally has determined there were
potentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banks
and savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bank
holding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.
    It said Citicorp's proposal "properly may be viewed as the
permissible acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of S
and L branches rather than the acquisition of an S and L."
    Citicorp Savings, the successor to the failed Fidelity
Savings and Loan Association, has assets of 4.9 billion dlrs
and operates 86 branches in California, mainly in the north.
    Sears Savings has 6.6 billion in assets and 91 branches
predominantly in southern California.
    The application, which was approved unanimously, will not

Brookehill Partners Inc told government authorities it may
support a buyout of Cardis Corp as a way to maximize the value
of the company's stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the group disclosed that it currently holds a 5.5 pct stake in
Cardis common stock, and said it "would likely support" an
acquisition of the company as a whole or in parts by another
party, terming such a move "the most likely means for the
company's shareholders to maximize the value of their
investment."
    Although the group characterized its Cardis stock holdings
as principally for investment, it said it intends to contact
third parties who might be interested in an acquisition of
Cardis, a Los Angeles-based auto parts distributor.
    The group added its has already had "some contacts" with
others concerning the company, but said no understandings have
been reached.
    "The (Cardis) common shares continue to offer opportunity
for price appreciation on the basis of the company's asset
value and earnings momentum," the Brookehill group told the
SEC.
    The group, which currently holds 318,900 Cardis common
shares, consists of New York-based Brookehill Partners and its
two subsidiaries, Brookehill Equities Inc, a brokerage, and
Moore, Grossman and deRose Inc, an investment advisor. Walter
Grossmman, S. Edward Moore and Robert deRose, all of New York,
each own one-third interests in Brookehill Partners.
    Since April 27, members of the Brookehill group made net
purchases of 6,000 Cardis common shares at approximately 4 dlrs

additional Cardis stock, but also reserved the right to sell

29-JUN-1987 13:06:47.50;None;None;None;None;SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES;    WASHINGTON, June 29 - ;The Securities and Exchange
Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly
disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a
takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.
    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its
legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the
agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping
center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's
takeover offer.
    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs
on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.
    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had
urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a
share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping
centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.
    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads
the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of
Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC
filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in
sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.
    Securities law requires takeover target companies to
promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.
    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct
of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a
share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed
by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at
thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.
    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an
amended SEC filing, the agency charged.
    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was
made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct
3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint
said.
    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for
control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October
when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or
48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes
after it dropped its hostile tender offer.
    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal
judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in
Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.
    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining
with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal
tender offer.
    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was
dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.
    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,
the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply
with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.
    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it
became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and
quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.

income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and
Aruba.
    The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury
said in a two-sentence announcement.
    The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations
between the United States and the Netherlands over the past
eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman
said.
    The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of
Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no
longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the
spokesman said.
    Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles 
may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have
maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the
spokesman said.
    He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an
adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general
decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance
at lower interest rates.
    However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced

    The main consumer country the United States and main

when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in

    Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in

29-JUN-1987 14:36:03.84;None;None;None;None;SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING;    SAN FRANCISCO, June 25 - ;Corporate mergers and acquisitions
in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had
only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
leading business-backed organization said.
    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business
firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered
some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
communities had not.
    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left
due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
another 21 firms were added to the list.
    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.
During the period, only six located in the city achieved
Fortune 500 status.
    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of
McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study
grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
hurt the economic climate of northern California.
    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
created during the period.
    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
of the United States and California.
    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and
chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news
conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
political system.
    But he said that because of the amenities of living in San
Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
metropolitan area.
    "It's a great place to run a business," he added, "but it's
a hell of a place to do business with government."
    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf
Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
restructuring activity.
    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &
Cooke and Rolm.
    Companies that grew enough during the period to make the
Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,
McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.
    The study by the management consulting firm said that,
partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.
    In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and
charitable activities.

Corp's <CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a
new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln
barrels, industry analysts said.
    Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.
Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API
crude oil from the tertiary "Alba" sand through a three-inch
surface choke.
    "The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320
mln barrels," Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
and Co told Reuters.
    He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the
field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of
oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25
pct.
    Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the
potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the
field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be
plugged and a sidetrack drilled.
    "The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will
require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs
up," Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.
    Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil
found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well
showed that it flows well.
    "Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,
it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be
recovered," Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.
    However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the
analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further
research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not
disclose any reserve figures.
    Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial
and developed, there would be a ready local market for the
heavy crude it produced.
    "Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and
the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a
lot narrower today," Osborne said.
    Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which
include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons
(UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltd
and Phillips Petroleum Co U.K. Ltd.

    Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to

    "We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the
crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and
Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to
produce during the past few months," he said.
    Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean

members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase
in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.
    "They understood our position and we believe we remain

    Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production
was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.

meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to
make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has
deeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said
    The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign
ministers from both countries and by French President Francois
Mitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of West Germany.
    The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to
providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the
Community's worst-ever budget crisis.
    "The Germans clearly do not want to budge," an aide to Chirac
told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly
angered as he the hour-long meeting.
    Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for
the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the
EC's complex "green" currrency system, designed to translate
common EC farm prices into national currencies.
    Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which
West Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and the
Netherlands.
    EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the
package, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline
tomorrow.
    Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have
injected fresh impetus into those talks.
    The Commission proposed its package to save one billion
dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget.
    The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to
alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and
plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.

exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at
14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,
Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
    Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
measure is "fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
strength of the petroleum industry."
     He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state
oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its
problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when
the measure would become effective.
   Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
   The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more
government debt bonds.                        
    PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust
fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in
government bonds.
  According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,
the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by
repurchasing the bonds.
    PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480
billion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial
sales were 8.023 billion dlrs.

29-JUN-1987 15:50:49.97;None;None;None;None;INTEREST RATES HURT U.S. MAY HOUSING SALES;    NEW YORK, June 29 - ;Sales of new single-family homes
tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher
mortgage interest rates, analysts said.
    "There should be another month or two of very weak new home
sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
should become more stable by mid-summer," said economist
Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.
    The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce
Department said.
    Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at
about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,
according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.
    The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out
of the market, he and others said.
    "The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly
unexpected by homebuyers," said Cynthia Latta, an economist
with Data Resources. "They were so startled, they wanted to
hold back and see what would happen."
    The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was
sharper than expected, some economists said. "We fully expected
a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated," said
James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.
    Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of
existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new
homes.
    Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new
condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were
reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.
    Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,
"Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market
is going to stabilize and give us a good second half."
    Others were less optimistic, however.
    "We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I
don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family
housing," said Chimerine of Wharton.
    Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan
Bank of New York, said, "The lower sales level will be
maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.
There won't be much specific improvement in coming months."

29-JUN-1987 15:55:28.71;None;None;None;None;U.S. REASSERTS PLANS FOR DETERRENT ROLE IN GULF;    WASHINGTON, June 29 - ;The United States responded to an
apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued
assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would
play purely a deterrent role.
    "I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and
that that shipping is not related to the war itself," State
Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
    He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States
was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.
    Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
"At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of
an armed encounter with us.
    "We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.
Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We
are determined to stand firm and will certainly win."
    The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its
Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the
strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.
    The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil
tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag
and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.
    Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, "We won't have any comment or response to
the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about
the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war
with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
helpful or welcome."
    Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that
Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.

29-JUN-1987 16:46:09.19;None;None;None;None;ISRAEL MINISTER SEES INCREASED EXPORTS TO U.S.;    NEW YORK, June 29 - ;Israel's exports to the U.S. can and
must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's
goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad
Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.
    Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce
seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.
were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total
exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion
dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.
    "I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach
five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to
function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis
on product quality," Yaacobi said.
    While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European
currencies is a "bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,"
Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend
toward higher U.S. exports.
    In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose
fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while
imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.
    Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct
annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
     He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed
last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial
restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would
continue to facilitate the desired export growth.
    Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as
an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.
firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage
of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.
    Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle
east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able
to achieve its economic potential.
    Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in
aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing
military conflicts "which were imposed on Israel," he said.
    Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,
Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic
independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that
exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

Hanover, West Germany, jointy announced they signed an
agreement for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Inc
subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash.
    Under the agreement the companies said Continental will
acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and
foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the
medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired
on or before November 30, 1984.
    The sale is expected to be completed on or before November
one and is subject to meeting certain conditions.
    Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last
year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9
billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.
    Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln
dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating
profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.
    GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain
about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire
employees under the agreement.
    Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to
reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.
    In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a
partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and
Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase
of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs
a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs
    As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned
to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO
General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast
properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive
components businesses.
   
    Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs
in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of
several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,
including general tire.
    "The price paid for General tire would not cause us to
reevaluate that estimate," said Tilden.
    General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four
tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.
    In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said
the sale of General Tire "represents a critical accomplishment
in our plan to restructure GenCorp."
   
    Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of
its other businesses are "proceeding satisfactorily."
    Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold
are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's
KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for
217 mln dlrs. That deal awaits approval by the Federal
Communications Commission. GenCorp also received 257 dlrs after
tax from the sale of RKO's WOR-TV.

29-JUN-1987 17:33:44.76;None;None;None;None;PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS;    ISLAMABAD, June 29 - ;Pakistani government allowed freer
cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
televised speech the government had also decided to allow
duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
Pakistani products.
   
    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
1970s.
    But Haq said now the private sector would also export
cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
long-standing demand of the local traders.
    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
compete effectively in the world market, he said.
   
    Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
reviewed every year.
    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
longer period.
    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
countries on soft credit terms.
   
    Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
    He said the government policy was to rationalise and
streamline import controls.
    "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," he
said. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
to smuggling and hampering of exports."
   
    He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
from import restrictions.
    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

convert the branches to banks at that time.

meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two
countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.
    The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
to last February. However, any delay this year should not
endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
through September, 1988, USDA officials said.
    "It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
meeting during July," an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel
Amstutz said.
    Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
next talks could still be a "couple more months," he said.
   
    There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA
will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations
were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
    "I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
or before the next agreement year begins," a USDA source said.
    Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next
year's crops, he said, "There are too many variables now. It
would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now."
    Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a
minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and
U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of
a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping
logistics and production outlooks.

the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the
nation's two largest intercity bus companies to merge their
operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.
    Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by
Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp
prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger
plan.
    Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company
hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow.
    "Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only
if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control
of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its
operations," Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the
federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers
of interstate bus companies.
    But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that
it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn
down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways
immediately.
    "The department has just begun to receive relevant
information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the
process of assessing the correctness of the company's
allegations," acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule
said in comments submitted to the ICC.
    Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let
it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to
evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.
    Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of
Trailways' terminals, buses and garages.
    The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that
Trailways "could collapse in a matter of days."
    They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs,
with another six mln dlrs due June 30.
    The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into
bankruptcy "at any time."
    Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and
the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways
fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.

the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.

strong yen for the rise in unemployment.
    The seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in May rose
to a record 3.2 pct, surpassing the previous record 3.0 pct set
in July 1986. This compares with 2.9 pct in April and 2.7 pct a

despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and

Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
serious way, Japan investment managers say.
    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
    But "if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
significant funds from U.S. Shares," said Akira Kawakami, deputy
manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
international investment department.
    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
investment in U.S. Bonds. "Japan-U.S. Interest rate
differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
in the absence of dollar stability," said Kawakami.
    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
    "Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
lighten their U.S. Stock inventories," Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
department said.
    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
    "Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
considering the dangers," said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
income securities marketing group.
    Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
    "The basic background which has supported the stocks and
bonds markets has not changed," said Norio Okutsu, assistant
general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. "But new
outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing."  However,
this was already evident three months ago, he said.

20-OCT-1987 00:15:04.00;None;None;None;None;ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS;    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - ;Asian cocoa producers are expanding
output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.
    "Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
from our product," said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate
general of plantations. "We're happy about our long-term future."
    Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable
for European tastes.
    They were responding to comments by London traders that
large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa
prices.
    London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered
unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
high level of free fatty acids.
    Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'
Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the
United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western
Europe.
    A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the
London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with
high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.
    "When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
talk down prices," the spokesman said.
    He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
    PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the
Netherlands and Britain.
    The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official
who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem
with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described
criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as "trade politics"
and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it
did not have any difficulty with exports.
    Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity
producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
    Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to
total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
    This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest
cocoa growing area.
    Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is
projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
this year as young trees mature.
    Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and
traders said they could last out low prices longer than West
African countries.
    According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would
have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.
    Some traders believe the main quality problem is with
harvesting and fermentation techniques.
    One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually
indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the
same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian
estates.

raw cotton may be spoiled by rain in Tanzania's northern

village sheds, radio Tanzania reported.
    The cotton, worth one billion shillings, cannot be moved to
ginneries in the region because most mill warehouses are full.
Many mills are not working because of a lack of spare parts, it
added.

Philippines was closely monitoring interest rates in the wake
of Monday's record drop on Wall Street and steep declines in
Manila and other Asian stock markets.
    "We will monitor these developments closely and will
continue to hope that they do not precipitate large declines in
economic activity around the world," Aquino told a meeting of 13
major Philippine business groups.
    "The Philippines, as a trading country in the world economy,
depends on the continued health and growth of both the world
economy and the world trading system," she said.
    The Manila Stock Exchange composite index plunged 105.49
points or 11.79 pct by the midday close to 789.54, depressed by
the record 508 point fall of the Dow Jones industrial average
on Monday.
    "The Philippines, in addition, as a large borrower nation,
is affected by developments in interest rate levels around the
world and will carefully monitor the impact of these
developments on interest rates, on gold and on commodity
prices," Aquino said.
    "We welcome the statements from world leaders that urge calm
in the present difficult situation," she added.

conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil
supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,
Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military
action in the Gulf.
    But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, he said, "If worst comes to worst and say
the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely
shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,
can take care of the situation."
    "But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
the situation," he declared.
    Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
short-term impact on prices, he added.
    Assessing future price trends, he said, "Short-term spot
prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
barrel.
    "The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
than the downward ones."
    "The balance between supply and demand in the short term
will still be delicate," he added. "Non-Opec production may still
go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase
in world demand."
    Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which
has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play
havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.
    In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a
plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he
said.

interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has
no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl said.
    "We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred
here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"
Poehl told an investment conference.
    "I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest
in higher capital market rates," he said.
    Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a
tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
pct.
    Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct
at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
late September.
    The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
    These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
currency developments.
    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said "You
have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."
 The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
said.
    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
    "Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
rates have risen substantially more," Poehl said.
    This had to be taken into account when considering recent
rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
rising international money market rates that had spilled over
into the German market, he said.
    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
    "The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
definitely underway," he said, noting that this was not so
noticeable in absolute figures.
    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
attracted little attention, he said.

20-OCT-1987 05:08:54.04;None;None;None;None;PHILIPPINES APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF U.S. LABELLING BILL;    MANILA, Oct 20 - ;The Philippine coconut industry has
greeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a bill
requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.
    The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture
Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year
in lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.
    "Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the
bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another
Senate bill," a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of
the Philippines (UCAP).
    PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with
eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.
    The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association
(ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.
    He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during
the debate.
    "Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated
animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems
leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease," he said.
    U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that
saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would
discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour
of domestic unsaturated alternatives.
    Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated
against imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia.
    The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products
in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.
    Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use
account for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said.

20-OCT-1987 05:31:21.81;None;None;None;None;TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY;    TOKYO, Oct 20 - ;Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent
the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
government and private economists said.
    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
    Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
rate increase.
    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need to
support the stock and security markets," he said.
    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
business confidence, one government economist said.
    "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
be that big," said another.
    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
to financial market investments for profits during last year's
economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
inventories and step up capital spending, one government
economist said.
    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
one central bank official said. "That will at least take a
couple of days, if not weeks," he said.

Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East
Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company
spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1
offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.
    "Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300
metres within the Baong formation," he said.

20-OCT-1987 08:01:46.58;None;opec;None;None;INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS;    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - ;Indonesia told the oil industry on
Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
expenditure on exploration in return.
    President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
    "In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
production sharing contracts under the present laws," Suharto
said.
    "Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
the petroleum industry," he said.
    Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
    "As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
aware of this situation," Subroto said.
    "The government has already made the political decision to
entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
selective basis."
    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
industry sources say.
    Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
deep water conditions.
    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
that the oil price had recovered.
    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
industry for the regions in which companies operated.
    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
1986.
    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
contracts with foreign oil companies.
    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
operations was a government priority. There had been
misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
    He said the government wanted to finalise contract
extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
within 10 years. "This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."
    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
would be selective, based on how much capital would be
invested.

20-OCT-1987 08:17:36.42;aqazadeh;None;None;None;IRAN PLANS TO FILE LAWSUITS OVER U.S. RAID;    NICOSIA, Oct 20 - ;Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for
compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf
oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
    The lawsuits would be filed with competent international
bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted
telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the
damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.
    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
the attack, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was
preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to
a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle
City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
"except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence." Reacting to
Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,
Aqazadeh said: "Iran will also consider the case closed after
its retaliatory measure." Iranian officials have said their
response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests
around the world might come under attack.
    Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf
aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack
significantly affecting oil prices.
    IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the
attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the
entrance to the Gulf.
    "If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can
either, and this would be to everyone's harm," the radio quoted
him as saying.

reiterated his country would retaliate for U.S. Navy attacks on
Gulf oil platforms.
    "The U.S. Attack on Iran's oil platforms jeopardises our
national sovereignty ... And we will retaliate properly for
this perfidious American aggression," Mousavi told a news
conference in Damascus.  On Monday U.S. Navy warships blasted
the Rostam platform, and Navy personnel stormed a second
platform a few miles away. Washington said the operation was
aimed at destroying positions used by Iran to track and assault
neutral Gulf shipping.

Inc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pct
from 9-3/4 pct, reversing an increase that they announced just
last week.
    The reduction is effective immediately.
    No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemical
and Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at
9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market
rates would take.
    Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices,
money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investors
ploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the Federal
Reserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the
economy and the financial system.
    Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16
percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a
point (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday),
and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday's
average of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discount
rate cut to calm the markets, dealers said.

20-OCT-1987 09:42:45.60;None;None;None;None;U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED;    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - ;A voluntary compliance system for
monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
trade sources.
    "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one
analyst said.
    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
it will still be allowed entry.
    While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
monitoring controls, trade sources said.
    "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a
U.S. Customs spokesman said.
    "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
destination)," he said.
    Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
importers will abide by the quota system.
    "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.
     "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without
the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
producers' hands."
    Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
labelled.
    According to customs officials, several green coffee
importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
beans.
    "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst
Bernie Savaiko.
    Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
the U.S. in the near term.
    "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
threat," one trader said.

United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen
in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in
soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.
    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to
a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct
on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at
seven pct, it said.
    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and
330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months
following a huge increase in soymeal imports.
    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately
but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it
estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by
October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.
    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year
earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,
sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to
bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record
5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals
were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln
at that time last year.

consent of the company's shareholders if there are no
continuing directors in office or the approval of at least
three such directors cannot be obtained.
    The company also said it approved a certificate of

but previously undesignated and unissued shares of preferred
stock and adopted an employee stock ownership plan.
    Crazy Eddie also that it requested that the shareholder
group make a commitment not to take the company private until

20-OCT-1987 10:23:58.76;lyng;None;None;None;NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG;    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - ;The Soviets have not indicated an
urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng told Reuters.
    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
    "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
wheat subsidy)."
    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
summit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."
    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
discussion at a summit.
    "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
about," Lyng said.
    "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
not something that would be discussed with the President of the
United States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.
    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
long-standing agreement.
    "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
These are some of the questions we need to discuss."
    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
the agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn't
been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
agreement."

20-OCT-1987 10:24:06.81;lyng;None;None;None;LYNG SAYS INDIA FOOD AID PACKAGE NOT READY;    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - ;The United States and India have
not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the
drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said.
    Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countries
have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the
specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.
    "We have been talking about the potential needs that India
might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs
as well as the possibilities of assistance," Lyng said.
    "At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The
amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have
indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in
whatever way they deem most valuable," he said.
    There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would
offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export
enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419
of an amended 1949 law.
    Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree
on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that
Washington would prefer the package include something other
than donated food.
    "The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care
of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in
its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in
that," Lyng said.
    "We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we
still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the
import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we
always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to
cooperate with them," he said.
    Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials
during Gandhi's visit here, adding, "I just don't know of
anything that might be announced specifically."
    Asked if "the ball was in the Indians' court," he said, "Yes."
    Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening.

20-OCT-1987 10:41:35.67;None;None;None;None;LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS;    LONDON, Oct 20 - ;U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
    "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
dollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey of
Hoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear that
when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."
    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
    "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
other London and Tokyo analysts.
    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
    "It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
interest rates," he added.
    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
system.
    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
mind.
    "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said Capel's
Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger.
    "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
disappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted.
    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
is still on.
    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability.
    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
Morrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said.

20-OCT-1987 10:43:03.06;None;None;None;None;U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA;    LONDON, Oct 20 - ;An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
economists said.
    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
    "In the normal course of events the markets would have been
extremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
from plummetting equities into the relative security of
government securities.
    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
throughout.
    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "With
the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
thing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said.
    "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"
said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
    But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
down is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
markets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be a
straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
sales," Temperton said.
    "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.
    "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
serious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said.
    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
than bank lending.
    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
personal sector borrowing.
    Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to
soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank
officials said Tuesday.
    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the
reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with
about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on
October 5. He declined to elaborate.
    A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told
Reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at
the end of the year.
    "The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus
and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank
market," Chang said.
    Taiwan's trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion U.S. Dlrs
in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a
year earlier, official figures show.
    Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said the surplus
will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year.
About 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island's trade
with the United States. 
    Chien said Taiwan's trade will reach 80 billion U.S. Dlrs
this year compared with 63.96 billion last year.
    Its exports are expected to total 50 billion and imports 30
billion against exports of 39.79 billion and imports of 24.17

20-OCT-1987 10:47:23.81;None;opec;None;None;NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER;    OSLO, Oct 20 - ;Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
rescue project.
    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
said.
    September production was also sharply higher at the
Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
August.
    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
days.

Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the U.S. Attacks on two of
its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.
    "God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days
and make them sorry," said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament
later broadcast by Tehran Radio.
    The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance
after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.
    President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi
and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all
vowed retaliation.
    Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, "It is not a
threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will
respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it
in practice." He added that the American attack "squares neither
with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with
security, nor reason and wisdom."
    U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and
American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.
    The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response
to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti
tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday.

20-OCT-1987 11:27:25.97;lyng;None;None;None;LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL;    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - ;U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
    "We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
It will help us in getting the negotiations underway," Lyng
told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
unrealistic.
    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said "The alternative to
doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
think that is the unrealistic position."
    "I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
trying to say."
    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
started.
    "All that some countries would like to have would be a
wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
That doesn't do a thing for us," Lyng said.
    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
said.
    At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is
expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.
    The United States will be represented at the meeting by
former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently
appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.

(IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to
submit details of past export performance in order that
individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.
    He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed
acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals
to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export
performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.
    Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be
used for calculating the export performace portion.
    The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers
participation and use this as a basis for allocation of
individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.
    He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo
Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.
Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable
on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this
premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export
sales declaration form.
    Auctions will not start until after the opening of export
registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be
but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of
the week, opening registraions from Monday.
    A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the
CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for
allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,
the spokesman added.
    A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished
in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure
shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.

pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax
on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax
which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.
    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on
Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism
for cereal substitutes.
    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the
Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair
meetings of their EC colleagues.
    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help
the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability
for producers.
    This would in turn help the market position for certain
crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas
and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe
output restrictions.
    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax
on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats
succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC
price fixing.
    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its
proposals for a tax.
    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue
international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of
bridging the gap between EC and world prices.

sold the stake he held in Gillette Co <GS> after deciding that
he could not force Gillette to accept a 47 dlr a share takeover
bid made by Revlon Group Inc <REV>.
    Revlon's bid expired last week after being repeatedly
rejected by Gillette. Jacobs had earlier considered waging a
proxy fight over Gillette.
    Jacobs told Reuters he sold the Gillette stake, which he
called "substantial" but under five pct, a few weeks ago over a
period of several days. He said he sold the stock at a profit,
but did not disclose the selling price.
    Gillette's stock was at 24-1/8, up 1/8, in morning trade,
off the high of 45-7/8 reached after Revlon announced its bid.
    Jacobs said he sold his Gillette stake based on an
"investment decision. I surely did not see this happening," he
said of Monday's stock market free-fall.
    A Gillette spokesman said the mpany had no comment.
    Jacobs said he and fellow investor Carl Pohlad continue to
hold a stake in Allegheny International Inc <AG>. In August
they disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
that they had acquired 854,900 shares, or 7.9 pct, of Allegheny
and would consideer seeking control of the company.

former chief of staff, said the government should loosen the
money supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reduce
the federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.
    "I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our
economy," the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc
<MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network.
    "We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest rates
down. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're going
to have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit
and the trade deficit," Regan said.
     "I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular
moment," Regan said when asked about the prospects for a
recession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.
    "I think that if they were to do that, they'd create the
same conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the money
supply and what happened? We went into a major recession. I
think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now."
    Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions
on program trading. "I think that that's exacerbated,
exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that they
must stop," he said.

said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint
against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in
negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.
    The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan
end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the
end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will
favor the U.S.
    "These are quota items, and the principles that apply to
them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of
whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus," Lyng
told Reuters in an interview.
    He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on
beef and citrus after March 31, next year.
    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United
States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some
cheeses and specialty fruit juices.
    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would
be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has
been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus
quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect
Japanese farmers.
    "We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on
beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an
illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.
    He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next
April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.

20-OCT-1987 13:33:18.08;None;None;None;None;ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT;        LONDON, Oct 20 - ;The American Soybean Association (ASA)
denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
remedy the situation.
    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
Outlook 87 conference: "It will be filed unless the EC takes
drastic and immediate steps."
    "These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
established in 1962," he said.
    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
make the regime non-discriminatory.
    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
has risen dramatically since then.
    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
oils and fats tax.
    The subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell," Adams
said.
    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
EC policies, Adams added.
    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

20-OCT-1987 13:33:38.61;None;None;None;None;U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES;    LONDON, Oct 20 - ;The United States is prepared to "pull out
all the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
to GATT Michael Samuels said.
    Those rights are now being challenged by the European
Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
shipments into the EC.
    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
prices over the current market level and which may be extended
to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
negotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
erected," Samuels said.
    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, "visionary"
and "very serious."  The EC and Japan have said it is
unrealistic.
    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
next week.
    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
farm subsidies.
    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
trade distortions, Samuels said.
    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
submitted and respond to it officially then.
    "We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"
the U.S. Ambassador said.
    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
    The key difference between the two approaches is that the
U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
correct the international trade situation, he added.
    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

20-OCT-1987 13:34:56.67;None;None;None;None;US WARNS IRAN, BEGINS ESCORTING TANKER CONVOY;    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - ;The United States warned Iran again 
that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military
action in the Gulf as U.S. warships began escorting another
tanker convoy southward from Kuwait.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the U.S.
sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with
any Iranian response to Monday's attack on an Iranian oil rig.
    Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S.
warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers --
the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton
liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait.
    The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S.
flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT
under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford. It
did not say what oth U.S. warships were in the area.
    "It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the
central Gulf," the Pentagon statement said.
    Asked on NBC's "Today" program if the United States was
prepared for a major war with Iran, Weinberger said, "Well we
are prepared I think for whatever eventualities emerge from
this situation but we don't look on it as a war."

Lyng said the United States will continue its policy of
subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is
a global agreement to end such subsidies.
    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was
troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program
(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports
that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.
    "Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit," he said. "There's
no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,
the longer it is to wean it."
    In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing
list of commodities to an increasing number of countries.
    Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies
"just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy" and said he saw an
end to the expansion of the EEP.
    "I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing
this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that
we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,
particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are
the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that
we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to
some agreement to put an end to it," he said.

has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
this year's planned output.
    Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
which began in late 1983.
    Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,
slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.
    January-September figures released at the weekend showed
Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467
mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.
    Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil
deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog
prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.
    The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988
budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.

    He said the dispute was a row which should not have

20-OCT-1987 13:59:05.95;None;None;None;None;BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE;    BONN, Oct 20 - ;The United States appears to have won a
transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
rates, European economists said.
    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
plunging.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
according to official statements released late Monday.
    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
facility rate offered last week.
    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
     "It's round one to the Americans, " said Richard Reid,
senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
London.
    But Reid added, "We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
percentage point."
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
    "The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
with Baker's wishes, then all the better," he said.
    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
in the U.S., Aschoff said.
    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
Ltd in London said "The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
before the IMF meeting last month in Washington."
    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
    Economists said the United States now appeared to have
agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

20-OCT-1987 14:04:18.88;de-clercq;ec;None;None;EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA;    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - ;The European Community (EC) agreed a
trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
officials said.
    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
officials said.
    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade).
    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
been affected by the country's EC membership.
    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
fish dispute with Canada.
    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
with Japanese offers of compensation.
    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
journalists: "We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
concessions were not enough."
    "We hope that there will be an improvement," he said.

Lawson said the collapse of British share prices this week held
no implication so far for domestic interest rates.
    He said in a television interview that "there is nothing in
the events of the past few days to increase the upward pressure
on (U.K.) interest rates."
    Sterling has so far stayed solid during the crisis, backed
by strong economic fundamentals and by 10 pct bank base lending
rates, analysts said. Lawson's comments followed another
frantic day in London's financial center, where British shares
closed 12.2 pct down on the day.

involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end
Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that
could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.
    The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to
comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate
bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout
of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
    The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit
debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan
to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls
for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the
situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.
    The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,
including an expression of support or of disapproval for
Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in
the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy
began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.

was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic
policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but
added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.
    Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry
Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday,
"There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United
States)." He added. "Criticism is not a one-way street."
    He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S.
To reduce its federal budget deficit.
    Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic
policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here
were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to
stabilise currencies.
    Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with
Baker had resolved differences between the two countries.
    At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had
declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he
had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, "one
remark or another has been clarified."

20-OCT-1987 15:28:37.56;None;None;None;None;US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS;    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - ;U.S. military planners ruled out
Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
raided another in what the administration called a "measured and
appropriate response" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
home and in the Gulf.
    "It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
action when they (Iran) take military action," Norman Polmar, a
defense analyst and author, said.
    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
Security Council call for a ceasefire.
    "We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
chance at all," he said, adding that the action made it clear
tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.

   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
lower Gulf.
    "We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
capabilities," Cordesman said.
    He predicted the United States would respond to any future
major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, "but
we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
by Iran with stronger countermeasures."

speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action
to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources
said.
    Spain is threatened with massive imports from third
countries by the end of the year, they said.
    They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the
accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will
import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum
into Spain from third countries this year.
    Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a
reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may
decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to
make direct purchases.
    The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries
should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the
Spanish market.
    They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC
Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached
would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.
    The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the
meeting.

shareholder rights plan which will allow shareholders to
purchase one common share for two dlrs if a hostile group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company.
    However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by
purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer
commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group
controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman.
    It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one
basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed
before they become exercisable at five cents per right.
    The company said the rights will expire on the later of
February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become
exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect
stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of
the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics
such as market accumulations which would interfere with its
ability to maximize stockholder value.
    The rights become exercisable if any person or group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other
than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding
shares at 65 dlrs per share.
     It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the
company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its
board.

ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag.

"I believe what the United States has done is their

share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one

for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
affect the acquisition.
    "If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"
said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
    "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"
Alpert said.
    "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
share, then they won't go at a lower price," another analyst
said.
    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
to retain its original offer.
    However, industry sources were more uncertain about
prospects for the deal.
    "With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
look good to Irving shareholders," said Michael Flores, a
consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
industry.
    "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
is too depressed," Alpert said.
    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
    "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
more than the acquirees," another analyst said.

was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs,
compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in
September last year, Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department
(Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference.
    September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down
from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted
to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.
    Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period
was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a
similar 1986 period.
    Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222
mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.
    The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade
surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months
of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach
10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and
15.4 billion dlrs of imports.
    He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured
and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which
accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept
period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.

20-OCT-1987 17:11:05.37;None;None;None;None;TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP;    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - ;As official Washington sought to
restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
international accord to stabilize currency values.
    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
damage the world economy.
    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, "I
think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic." It was a
dispute that should never have happened, he added.
    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, "His
timing could not have been worse."
    One government bond salesman in New York said, "He actually
thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
understanding of international monetary gamesmanship."
    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
    "On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
markets), it was West German policy," said Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities International in New York.
    "All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
messenger," he said.
    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
in Paris in February, was still in effect.
    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
market for debtor country exports.
    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
tarnished.
    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
    "There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,"
former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
television interview.
    In many ways, the official response was mild.
    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
that he was "puzzled."
    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
and, presumably, their political impact.
    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
Bentsen said with some irony, "Oh, I think it's much too late to
be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do
that."

American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards
Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being

    Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well

additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
portable computers.
    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
below production costs.
    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
    The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
sales away from American-made semiconductors.
    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
be lifted by the end of the month.
    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
with the agreement earlier this week.
    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is
in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.

Pacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas which
would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil
Slenniken said in an interview.
     The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was
artificially developed several years ago. The plant, which has
been grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in
three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint
than wood pulp, a CIP official said.
     Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a

would need partners to begin the project.
    "We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of
dollars it would take for such a project," Slenniken said.
     He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to
make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct
softwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.
    CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently

seven major industrial nations agreed to stabilize currency
exchange rates.

of various public statements by Southland," Southland said in a

    Southland did not elaborate on the SEC order of

Southland by a company controlled by Southland chairman John

President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets
in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy
in the volatile region.
    Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed
Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in
retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship
flying the American flag.
    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.
resolve that Iran "cannot take military action against the
United States with impunity."
    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and
set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role
in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require
Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead
to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
    While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.
retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing
U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan
comply with the War Powers Act.

international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm
subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister
Pat Carney said.
    "Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a
vicious circle which continues to cause problems of
overproduction and low commodity prices," Carney told the House
of Commons.
    Carney was outlining the government's new position on the
farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the
multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade).
    While few details were released, Carney said the government
would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and
new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial
barriers.
    "Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to
ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the
specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," a
government background paper said.
    "Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,
credit could be given to countries which effectively control
the output of farm products," the papers said.

19-OCT-1987 20:07:36.38;yeutter;gatt;None;None;US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE;    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - ;Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
global trading system.
    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
many services.
    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
pacts "other countries have realized that if they want to
continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
better get serious about improving the GATT."
    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
increase the gross national products in both countries.
    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
    Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys to
enhanced political and economic stability around the globe."
    He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
of living."
    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
protectionism.
    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
rising.
    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
    He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."

Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard

    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great

in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
markets.
    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
spokesman in Bonn said.
    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
deficit.
    West German government sources said rising West German
money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
    German yields have also risen over this period, but less
markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
money market.
    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
bank economists said.
    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
    "They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
under American fire," said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
Swiss Bank Corp here.
    "It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
significant retreat from its position," added Giles Keating,
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
economists said.
    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
Denmark and Belgium.

19-OCT-1987 19:38:35.74;None;None;None;None;EX-ARCO <ARC> CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990;    HOUSTON, Oct 19 - ;Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
    "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Anderson
told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "I
believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."
    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
    "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
East," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where we
were in 1973 and 1979."
    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
    "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
enough supply," he said. "There have been no major oil
discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."
    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)
because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
    He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in
compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil
production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an

    "For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its
right to produce 221,000 bpd," he said. "We should recognize
Ecuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of
justice in that country's petition."
    He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to
avoid harming the market, he added.
    Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would
formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next
ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.

of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations.
    Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the
incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the
delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
    U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary
General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal
last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued
efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.
    In his explanation, Walters said the United States took
defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against
American ships in the Gulf.
    He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in
Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle
City.
    Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian
platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United
States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes.
    "In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations
(Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that
United States forces have exercised the inherent right of
self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action
in response to attacks by . . . Iran against United States
vessels in the Gulf," Walters said.
    Members of the Security Council met behind closed doors on
Monday to discuss developments in the Gulf war, but no

President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in
the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress
debate over limits on his powers to make war.
    The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships
destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf
ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second
Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on
a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.
    Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans
expressed support for the attack and praised it as an
appropriate "measured response."
    But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that
the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States
could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply
with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of
American forces from the waterway.
    "Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize
their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war
with Iran," said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.

tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow
and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.
    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a
10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes
the plan would be adopted this year.
    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.
    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an
amendment to a farm spending reduction package.
    "I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving
American consumers the information they need," he said.
    Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean
Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils
are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.
    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating
tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage
consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,
Indonesia and the Philippines.
    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal
"blatantly discriminates" against imports, would be impossible to
defend under international trade law and would harm relations
with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their
saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively
little from tropical oils.
    The committee voted largely along party lines, with three
Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.

President Jacques Delors called for a swift convening of a
meeting of the G-7 countries following the instability in
today's trading on world money and stock markets.
    He told a press conference here: "G-7 should meet discreetly
and quickly."
    Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the
mark to levels around 1.60, the European Monetary System would
undergo a "test by fire."
    Delors said the current problems in the markets had been
caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive
deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world
economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing
circumstances.
    He said it was "profoundly unjust" to blame it on recent
increases in West Germany.

met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today in West Germany and
agreed to support the Louvre pact, the Treasury Department
said.
    The Treasury described the meeting as "a very positive,
private meeting in Frankfurt, West Germany which had been
agreed upon last week. "The parties agreed to continue economic
cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible
application including cooperation on exchange rate stability
and monetary policies," the Treasury said.
    The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg "are consulting with
their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable
them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels."
    The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries including the United States and
West Germany to promote currency stability.
    Baker was scheduled to visit Scandinavia and Belgium this
week and the department earlier refused to release details of
his travel itinerary, citing security considerations.

Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted Iran will retaliate for the
U.S. strike against its oil platform though he said Iranian
options were limited.
    "They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred,
and let me stress for you that our commitment there is not
going to be risk free or casualty free."
    He said the most likely Iranian response would involve
terrorism or the laying of mines.
    "They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in
line with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,"
Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.
    He declined comment on a reporter's query whether he
favored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the
president.
    "We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we
carried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was
professionally and well done," Crowe said.

platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a
second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile
attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.
    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military
escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile
waterway.
    Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by
four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells
at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central
Gulf.
    A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian
oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar
and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the
Pentagon said.
     Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters
that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian
personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.
    The United States said both platforms were being used to
keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat
attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.

19-OCT-1987 15:49:40.81;None;ec;None;None;EC, U.S. PLAN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS;    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - ;The European Community is willing to
offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two
major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations
next year, an EC commission spokesman said.
    He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this
month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC
External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq.
    EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture
ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make
some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S.
Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed
with growth hormones, the spokesman said.
    Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC
proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries
do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the
makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S.
Manufacturers.
    It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will
rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year.
    Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will
take place in London and will also involve the aerospace
ministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, the
countries involved in the Airbus project.

Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil
platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf
crisis.
    "The United States is fully entitled to take military action
in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the
imminent threat of further attacks," Howe said in a statement
issued in London.
    The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on
Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-
flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.
    Referring to that attack, Howe added, "I trust the Iranians
will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will
only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense."
    At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of
European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about
statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was
now involved in a full-scale war.
    "It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified
for Iran to react in that way," he said.

19-OCT-1987 15:35:53.55;None;None;None;None;HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS;    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - ;Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
of the structure remained.
    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
been caught laying mines.
    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
U.S. "tit-for-tat" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
    He said with this appraoch America would suffer "the death
of one thousand cuts."
    But for the United States to grab the initiative
militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
shipping must pass, Schuler said.
    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
settlement.
    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

19-OCT-1987 15:31:35.28;None;None;None;None;DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED;    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - ;A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    "We consider the matter closed," he said, a signal the U.S.
administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
would endanger American interests.
    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
"crushing blow."
    "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
no way get out safely," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
said.
    "The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
respond one way or the other," a diplomat said.
    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
the United States could have taken once it had decided to
retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
and Kuwaitis on Iran.
    "It's interesting that they chose something in international
waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation," one
diplomat said. "This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
Arab states, particularly Kuwait."
    Commented another diplomat: "Kuwait must be happy that the
U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
on its doorstep."
    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: "They
managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
least nuisance to everybody."
    A diplomat commented: "They were very clever in the place
they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
anything because it wasn't working in the first place."
    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans)."

19-OCT-1987 15:23:36.33;None;None;None;None;LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US;    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - ;Military experts say the United States
faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
U.S.-flagged tanker.
    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
limited retaliatory strikes.
    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
    "Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
cycle of attack and retaliation continues," said Fred Axelgard,
a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).
    "It's like a Greek tragedy," said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
think tank.
    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
the war between Iran and Iraq.
    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
President Reagan could never accept.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
Isle City on Friday.
    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
allowed to escape.
    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.
    "We consider this matter closed," he said.
    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
this view after earlier clashes.

board adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to protect the
company from coercive takeover tactics and bids not fair to all
sharholders.
    Under the plan, the board declared a dividend of one share
purchase right for each of the Northeast common shares held of
record as of November two, the company said.
    Initially, the rights are not exerciseable, rights
certificates are not distributed, and the rights automatically
trade with Northeast's shares, the company said.
    However, 20 days following the acquisition of 20 pct or
more of Northeast's common shares shares or 20 days following
the commencement of a tender offer for 30 pct or more of
Northeast's shares, the rights will become exerciseable and
separate rights certificates will be distributed, the company
said.
    The rights will entitle holders of Northeast's common
shares to purchase additional shares at an exercise price of 60
dlrs a share, the company said.
    The company said that in the event of certain triggering
events described in the rights plan, holders of the rights,
other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to acquire
Northeast's common shares having a market value of twice the
then-current exercise price of the rights. Also, in the event
Northeast enters into certain business combination
transactions, holders of the rights will be provided a right to
acquire equity securities of the acquiring entity having a
market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the
rights, the company said. Northeast said it will be entitled to
redeem the rights at one cent per right until the occurence of
certain events.

19-OCT-1987 14:36:15.11;None;None;None;None;U.S. DRAFTS SANCTIONS IN ARGENTINA SOY CASE;    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - ;The U.S. is drafting options including
possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over
the differential between soybean and product  taxes which
Buenos Aires levies on exports.
    The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure
of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed
by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.
officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential
export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in
competition with the U.S.
    "Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict
(Argentine) access to our market," said one U.S. source.
   
    The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to
end the differential.
    But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88
year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.
    Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture
minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille
on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not
narrow the differential further for 1987/88.
    As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering
restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef
and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.
    A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan
administration soon, they said.

19-OCT-1987 14:04:26.45;None;None;None;None;SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT;    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - ;Recent announcements from Moscow of
next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets
are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,
Agriculture Department analysts said.
    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but
some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987
grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.
    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,
putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of
Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in
Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be
"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year."
    "This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213
mln tonne (grain) crop," the analyst said.
   
    In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235
mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
published in a Soviet economic journal this month.
    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a
range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.
    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest
progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.
    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture
official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be
as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.
    A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln
tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would
bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

19-OCT-1987 13:58:27.47;None;opec;None;None;AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT;    LONDON, Oct 19 - ;Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
    "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst with
stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
bpd, little changed from September levels.
    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
production at 18.5 mln bpd.
    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
Attack, analysts said.
    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
hostilities, analysts said.
    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
    "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said.
    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "a
responsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
chose to raise the level of conflict.
    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
retaliation.
    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinburger.
    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
analysts and traders said.

Monday's U.S. Attack on an Iranian offshore oil site and vowed
retaliation, Tehran radio reported.
    It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying, "We will
definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move
unanswered."
    A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian
personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east of
Qatar were injured when U.S. Warships bombarded them this

pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs

personnel and said the U.S. Attack lacked miltary value.

called to a private meeting on Monday for consultations 
following the United States attack on an Iranian oil platform.
    Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman said that as far as he knew a
report to the council and Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar on the action had not been received from the Americans.
    In Washington, President Reagan said the United Nations was
being informed of the attack under the provision of the U.N.
Charter regarding notification of actions taken under the right
of self-defense.
    The U.N. spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said Perez de
Cuellar had no comment on the attack, taken in response to
Iranian action against an American-owned tanker last week, but
was trying to find out "what actually happened."
    Calls to Iran's U.N. commission elicited no response.

of the U.K. Merchant bank <Baring Brothers and Co Ltd>, said it
has raised 61 mln European Currency Units (ECUs) which will be
invested in management buy-outs and development capital
opportunities in the U.K. And continental Europe.
    The funds were raised through BCI's first such fund - the
Baring Euaring European Capital Trust - from investors in nine
European countries. It expects to raise another 40 mln ECUs
soon through a French fund and a fund for U.S. Investors.
    BCI was set up last year by Baring Brothers to advise
buy-out and development capital investors.
    BCI said the new fund is structured as a Guernsey-based
unit trust, which will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange. It will be advised by BCI and managed by a company
owned jointly by Barings and the management of BCI.
    Individual investments are expected to range between one
and 10 mln ECUs and are likely to be concentrated in the U.K.,
Germany and France.
    BCI said its aims are to invest in established companies,
principally family companies with succession-issues and
corporate spin-offs.

rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the
Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar
free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,
economists and currency traders said.
    "I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up
in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the
dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.
It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,"
said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.
   
    In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary
James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German
money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to
foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.
    His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send
the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a
tailspin.
    The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about
1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at one
stage and U.S. Treasury bonds dropped about 1-3/4 points.

    Crazy Eddie said its board is not endorsing, but will
simply refrain from opposing, the EMI-Palmieri nominees.    
The board also said it will ask representatives of the
Committee to Restore Shareholder value to begin acquainting
themselves with the business and affairs of the company as
promptly as possible.
   
    To that end, the committee's representatives will be
invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the
company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to
join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers,
bankers and key personnel, Crazy Eddie said.
    The board said that to continue to oppose the EMI-Palmieri
group would only increase the expenses of the company, create
further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and
employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company
personnel.
    A further release from the company will follow, it said.

    The official, Kamal Kharrazi, said Washington had now

expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in
county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and
wheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.
    A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate
differentials to no more than one pct per year from the
national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.
    The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to
increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by
"an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected corn
stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.
    Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set
aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.

19-OCT-1987 11:59:35.68;None;None;None;None;TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS;    PARIS, Oct 19 - ;The Louvre accord on currency stability,
which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
the currency pact was still alive.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
interest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,"
Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
pact.
    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
    "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
are off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency
analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
view, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparently
reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
comment will regret it later on."
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithful
and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
Treasury commented on the row.
    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this does
not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
Louvre Accord."
    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
Was still committed to the accord.
    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
close to eight pct.

agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral
Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to
exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.
    Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish
group would  be responsible for the technical side of the
operation and would have no control over the product itself.
    He said one option under discussion for refining the gold
ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in
northern Sweden.
    Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it
was strategically important since it increased Boliden's
presence in Saudi Arabia.
    "Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar
already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the
future," he said.
    The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab
in the west of the country and should open in the first half of
1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold
smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.
    Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi
Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to
open in modern times.
    "This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining
technology and knowhow," said the group's chief executive, Kjell
Nilsson.

Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute
shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
Reuter inquiry
    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination
of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
hurricane which blocked roads.
    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
    This is the first time in many years that a factory has
been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
spokesman said.
    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
campaign.
    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has
severely restricted beet lifting.
    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet
available.

said it filed a suit charging Bregman Partners and its
affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the
company.
    In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International
Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who
reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take
the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman
Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the
Belzberg families of Canada.
    The complaint also discloses that on each occasion,
Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.
    Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares
in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the
market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks
compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be
determined.
    In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners
from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it
reportedly owns, the suit said.
    According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman
Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full
benefits of the company's restructuring.
    In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially
altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S.
consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected
segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.

banks of a further sharp rise in interest rates.
    However, Seidman, attending the American Bankers
Association convention, said he did not expect rates to rise
much higher and said the outlook for the U.S. economy and for
banking was sound.
    "The potential for greater interest rate rises gives us
concern. We see nothing right now in the outlook that causes us
to believe rates are going much higher or that the economy is
not sound," Seidman told a news conference.

Hong Kong-based investment firm leading a group holding 19.1
pct of Calmat Co's common stock, said it intends to submit to
Calmat a proposal for a possible business combination.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Industrial Equity (Pacific) did not disclose details of the
proposal, but said it would be delivered to Calmat in the near
future.
    Industrial Equity (Pacific) "does not intend to remain a
passive investor" in Calmat, the firm told the SEC.
    In its SEC filing, Industrial Equity (Pacific) said its
president of North American operations Ronald Langley met with
Calmat officials on October 14 to discuss an acquisition of the
company at a premium over the market price of Calmat stock.
    Industrial Equity (Pacific) added it is considering
launching a tender offer for Calmat stock or making a merger
proposal to the company, but said it has not decided whether it
will pursue a Calmat acquisition on a non-negotiated basis.
    Industrial Equity (Pacific), which currently holds 5.83 mln
Calmat common shares, said it is also evaluating the company's
recently adopted shareholder rights plan and its potential
effect on Calmat and on possible acquisition proposals made to
the company.
    Between October 2 and 14, Industrial Equity (Pacific)
bought 918,900 shares of Calmat common stock at 33 dlrs to
37.55 dlrs a share, or a total of about 33.8 mln dlrs.

19-OCT-1987 10:52:24.24;None;None;None;None;STUDY SAYS PORK LEANER THAN USDA FIGURES SHOW;    Chicago, Oct 19 - ;An Iowa State University study showed
pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by
long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the
National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.
    Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study
averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart
Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all
the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained
less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.
    Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the
established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat
content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.
    Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs
for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy
between the study and the USDA handbook.
    "Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information
that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The
statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today
which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,
thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,"
Kline said.
    The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,
evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories
from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat
content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,
moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.

19-OCT-1987 10:50:46.56;None;None;None;None;SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS;    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - ;The Soviet Union outlined its economic
targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve
standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.
    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet
industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a
planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.
    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a
planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the
output of a country's goods and services.
    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of
grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow
produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.
    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is
essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on
world markets.
    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
considerable amount of the equipment that it requires," said
Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.
    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987
compared with the same period last year.
    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned
for the industry for the whole of 1988.
    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent
meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
a large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scale
measures are planned to save resources," he said.
    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that
defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same
figure as was announced last year.
    Western governments view official Soviet estimates for
defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure
is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are
intertwined with the civilian economy.
    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending
next year on medical services, education, pensions and social
insurance schemes.

19-OCT-1987 10:50:27.55;None;None;None;None;TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM;    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - ;The official Soviet news agency Tass
denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in
the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would
bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.
    Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration
had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms
to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.
    "The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that
the latest military adventure will not bring political
dividends to the American administration," Krutikhin said.
    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on
Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
    Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
presence serves to increase tension.
    Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
broader contacts with Iran in the last year.
    Krutikhin said: "The United States has undertaken an act of
armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has
long been spoken of by Washington officials."

    To implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus on
consumer goods and services, the company will give serious
consideration to the sale of its Pneumo Abex, its aerospace and
defense company, if it can realize a price which will return
maximum value to shareholders.
    In 1986, Pneumo Abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrs
on sales of 900.5 mln dlrs.
    IC said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale to
invest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods and
services field.
    The company said it authorized a program to repurchase
between 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of IC's common stock
from time to time when conditions warrant.
    It also said it will begin an immediate cost-reduction
program to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs.
    An IC spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved
"across-the-board" cuts rather than specific about targeted
areas.
    IC's board earlier approved a plan to spin off the

    Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major

dlr deficit after 1.33 billion in June and 1.89 billion a year
earlier, with exports at 4.91 billion and imports, both FOB, at
6.76 billion.
    The government aims to narrow the current account deficit
for the whole of 1987 to 975 mln dlrs, compared with 1.52
billion last year, up from 1.01 billion in 1985.
    Bankers forecast the 1987 deficit will exceed one billion
dlrs,  because a spurt in exports is expected to slow
considerably in the last five months following a massive
drawdown of inventories.

19-OCT-1987 10:08:30.32;None;None;None;None;SWISS ANALYSTS SAY MOOD ON MARKETS PRECARIOUS;    ZURICH, Oct 19 - ;Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks and
matching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but the
mood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securities
analysts and economists said.
    Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the opening
on enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street and
the threat of renewed currency instability.
    "I have never experienced anything like this, and I've been
in the business for 20 years," said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head of
European research at Union Bank of Switzerland.
    The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetary
authorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
publicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary
policy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise
currencies was still working, but added: "On the other hand, we
will not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest
rates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United
States will raise rates."
    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in
Zurich said: "The situation is very dangerous. Statements by the
U.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates."
    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's
financial research department, called the sell-off "overdone,"
but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks
loosen their monetary policy.
    "I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over," he
said. "The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in
with an easy money policy, or else there is going to be an
economic catastrophe. They have to act quickly."
    Wyttenbach said the "Black Monday" sell-off was clearly
exaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation
certificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.
    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction
would come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investors
only in time for tomorrow's market, when there could be
another, smaller selling wave.
    "As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --
then we'll get a strong movement upward," Wyttenbach said. But
that may not come soon.
    "People are simply worried that in America, where the market
has now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,"
he said. "People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988."
    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current
problems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. "We do not have a
mark problem, we have a dollar problem," he added, but said the
biggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan.
    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the
dollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest
rates might have to rise. "As a central banker he shouldn't do
that," Wyttenbach said. "There is a danger that we will fall back
into the 1970s," he said. "We have a real crisis of confidence in
Greenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker."
    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.
    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: "I'm relatively optimistic
because the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has to
intervene."
    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take
any significant steps, adding that the focus of attention
remains on the United States.
    "The panic started in New York, it has to end there."
    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting
they not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while before
deciding what to do.

19-OCT-1987 10:04:35.30;None;None;None;None;SOVIET UNION SETS 4.5 PCT INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT GROWTH;    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - ;Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told
the Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to
rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.
    In the first nine months of this year, industrial output
rose by 3.6 pct.
    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct
against a planned 4.1 pct this year.
    He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in
1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.
    The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986
and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the
harvest this year.
    Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering
industry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the
Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.
    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
considerable amount of the equipment that it requires," said
Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.
    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this
year against the same period of 1986. This is well below the
7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.
    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent
meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
a large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scale
measures are planned to save resources," he said.
    Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet
defence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the
same as announced last year.
    Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase
spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and
social insurance schemes
    He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171
billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had
originally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan.

    Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platform

at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.
    "We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with

said at a Pentagon briefing. 
    "We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small
boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...
    "It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of
U.S. forces in the future," Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy's
operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.
    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will

    He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform
were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.
    "As far as we know they did abandon the site," he said.
    Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to
attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile
platforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack.

19-OCT-1987 08:56:47.50;None;None;None;None;S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS;    SEOUL, Oct 19 - ;South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,
said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion
dlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the
country's cheap cars and electronic goods.
    Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the
Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own
figures later in the week.
    Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current
account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled
7.03 billion dlrs.
    This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the
whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with
the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid
revaluation of the won against the dollar.
    The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,
up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.
    "Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many
public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will
be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten," Yonhap said.
    The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a
resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous
month.
    More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,
electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest
between July and September.
    The South Korean government originally targeted a five
billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise
this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export
boom.
    If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus
seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United
States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with
Seoul last year, government economists said.
    The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure
at home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to
American goods and revalue the won faster.
    The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,
representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year.

oil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at least
one of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.
    Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had
reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike
against Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil
drilling platforms and setting them ablaze.
    The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh
offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a
wave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from
the Rostam field soon after.
    At least one of the other two targets was also believed to
be ablaze, the sources said.
    The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi
air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any
southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.
    Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran
used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and
later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.
    U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had
already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran
attack but would not say what the decision was.

19-OCT-1987 08:34:27.31;None;None;None;None;SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN;    TOKYO, Oct 19 - ;Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key
supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least
the next five years, oil industry sources said.
    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and
butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi
Arabian LPG, the sources said.
    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate
of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. "Saudi
is a reliable supplier in that sense," said one trader.
    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.
    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an
LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.
    "Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,
which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf
could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities
in that area," said another trader.
    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20
pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at
Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to
contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from
other ports.
    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude
rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG
supply disruptions, traders said.
    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was
unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.
    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly
rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a
moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.
    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift
slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from
Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.
    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in
large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian
LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the
year ended March 1987, the sources said.
    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down
term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on
the spot market, they said.
    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which
5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term
contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of
Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.
    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made
some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the
recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the
Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.
    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been
unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to
replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.
    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by
Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87
pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)
of Arabian Light.
    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings
should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian
Light's GSP.
    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the
95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,
the trade sources said.
    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying
up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to
seller-buyer agreement.
    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut
supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.
    "If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable
basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct," said
an official at a major importer. "Freight costs are higher for
cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a
longer haul and war risk insurance payments."
    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to
finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on
contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to
current levels, the sources said. "When we talk business, we
would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of
high dependence on a single supplier," said one.

franc bond issues has been temporarily stalled by the Belgian
government crisis which has put the franc under pressure and
forced up interest rates, banking sources said.
    On Monday, King Baudouin accepted the resignation of
Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' coalition and asked
him to try to form a new government.
    Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA
(BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourg
francs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGL
director Robert Sharfe said.
    He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week.
    It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interest
rates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements, banking
sources said. However, no new placements are scheduled for
another 10 days.
    The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp
(SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issues
the interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct.
    Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in parity
with the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates.
    On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-month
Treasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgian
franc came under pressure.
    Private placements in Luxembourg francs have become
increasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers,
because they carry a relatively low interest rate.
    Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg franc
bond issues because the franc was seen as a fairly strong
currency.

tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising
their cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective from
October 24.
    The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank's
policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March and
is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.
    The central bank also put selective controls on bank
advances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.
    "The policy's main objective is to fully meet the credit
requirements of agriculture, industry and exports, while
preventing excessive monetary expansion," bank Governor R.N.
Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.
    Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept
under control in the second half of the current financial year.
    Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first six
months of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the same
period last year, according to the bank.
    Bankers said the bank's move to raise the cash reserve
ratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees
from the banking system. Banks' total deposits are estimated at
around 1,000 billion rupees.
    They said banks are under pressure because of low returns
on commercial lending and investments in government securities.
    "Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain
their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are
resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings," said one banker.

19-OCT-1987 07:25:22.85;None;None;None;None;GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION;    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - ;Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
central bank's independence.
    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
interest rates
    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
for foreign investors.
    "The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
investors," said one economist for a London broker, who asked
not to be identified.
    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
    "There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
feeling," said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
abroad.
    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
extraordinary pressures lately.
    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
views, bankers said.
    "Poehl is in a minority in his own house," said Commerzbank's
Pfister.
    "Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
entirely his own," said another economist.
    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
and hurting West German exporters.
    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
most popular government politician last year, had to face
resistance from local barons in the government coalition
parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
4.3 billion marks.
    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
allegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavy
losses for the CDU in state elections.
    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
gave Poehl another eight-year term.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."

recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the
government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988
after seven years of austerity, economists said.
    "Our country is walking on one leg now," said Ismail Salleh,
an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International
Studies. "It has to depend on public sector investment for
faster growth if the private sector is not moving."
    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking
one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.
    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under
two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct
because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.
Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and
semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.
    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion
ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.
    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct
in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.
    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen
blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.
    One businessman said too many politicians give the
impression that Malaysia was unstable.
    "If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential
to recover strongly is great," a banker said.
    Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the
black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit
surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.
    The government has said its fiscal policies will balance
the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.
    The government will also repay some of its external debt,
which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.
    Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt
ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential
goods are unlikely to change.
    Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the
corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to
compete for investors with neighbouring states.

poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers

rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government

pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,
Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.
    The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily
pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight
pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average
higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.
    The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the
Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).
    The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation
rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4
pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita
said. Both were proposed last month.
    Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct
by the National Economic and Development Authority early this
month.
    In the first three months of the year, inflation was a
negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5

Office said.
    The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct
in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September
respectively, the National Statistics Office said.
    It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water
prices.

    The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had

two billion bottles of moonshine.
    At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,

vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count

<STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field,
has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion
crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a
statement.
    Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier
A/S <KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert
Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating
production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
    Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S
<AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the
well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
    Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
months earlier than previously planned.
    Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
west of Bergen.
    Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,
including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output
is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.
    Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg

19-OCT-1987 04:51:52.40;james-baker;None;None;None;LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS;    TOKYO, Oct 19 - ;The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
    "The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
later on," the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
noted.
    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
against the mark or the yen.
    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
141.35 yen.
    "Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
of the Louvre accord," the Finance Ministry official said.
    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
problem.
    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
further, the monetary officials said.
    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
expectations in the U.S.
    "That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
agreement is still operative," the senior ministry official
said.
    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
statement that "the Louvre agreement is still operative," and
this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
dealers said.
    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
Tokyo currency markets.
    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
or international economic policy coordination.
    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
economic policies and from time to time apply "peer pressure" to
persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
they noted. "Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
policy so openly," the ministry official said.
    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
    He also said Japan has not received any specific request
from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
money rates have been edging higher.
    "This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons," he
added.

issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major
industrial countries.
    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at
the accords, said "I firmly desire a faithfull and firm
adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre
accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
    On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West
German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.
    The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called
for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged
dollar slide.
    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
Ministers in Washington last month.
    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."
    "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow
them," he added.

19-OCT-1987 03:50:41.47;None;inro;None;None;RUBBER STOCK MANAGER SAYS QUALITY ACCEPTABLE;    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 19 - ;International Rubber Organisation
(INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests had
shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but
acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.
    "We have said all along that the rubber is holding up well
from a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored in
proper conditions does not deteriorate," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber sold
since he entered the market in September would be discussed at
an INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.
    Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in
buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible
poor quality.
    Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the
"may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's
five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October
16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock
was uppermost in consumers' minds.
    "We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand
the Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber
before they carry on buying," he said.
    Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different
locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all
warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.
    Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the
past week to 10 days and this could reflect a "wait and see
attitude" by buyers, he said.
    "Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts
until they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,
they are likely to buy more." Hofmeister said he could reduce
the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest
but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.
    Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates
that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur
and New York since September.
    But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an
idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall
had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.
    The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne
buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council
meeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.
    The current international rubber pact expires on October
22.
    The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and
Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during
the interim period.

19-OCT-1987 02:35:59.87;None;None;None;None;ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR;    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - ;An income tax surcharge and capital
gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
current government policies.
    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
impact of a currency depreciation.
    The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
    "The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful," Bayliss said.

against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to
a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.
    The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut
economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement
which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in
March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about
10 mln dlrs a year.
    Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from
Suva for discussions about other possible measures.
    "We won't be reacting further until these discussions with
the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,"
Palmer said.
    The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after
Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25.
Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn
back from declaring a republic.
    Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from
Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the
Commonwealth had lapsed. Prime Minister David Lange is in

Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.
    A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of
Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind
and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in
December and the factory should be ready by next October.
    He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee
Marketing Board to supply his company <Unipack> with 24,000
tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also
told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan
from the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.
    Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and
expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.
    Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit
Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln
(60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the
latest International Coffee Agreement.
    In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be
substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.

Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels

    IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the
agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet
Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility
studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in
southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
    Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
    Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet
Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he

    Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf
war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined

nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the
significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
    "The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,"
said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
    "The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
sentiment after Baker's comments," said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
due to their fears of increasing inflation.
    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
pressures also slow domestic demand.
    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
deficit, Tanaka said.
    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
    "Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
coordinate dollar buying intervention," said Soichi Hirabayashi,
deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
department.
    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally
considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
    "The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations
failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre
accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,"
Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low
as 135 yen soon.

19-OCT-1987 00:18:22.79;None;None;None;None;SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987;    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - ;The Soviet Union's industrial output is
growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade
has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.
    Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show
industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of
1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.
    Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986
period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2
pct.
    Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion
roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.
    One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction
of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last
year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,
irrespective of quality.
    Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special
inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below
standard.
    Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were
rejected in the nine-month period.
    The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more
than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000
people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,
Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.
    The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the
economy has been an important part of the modernisation
campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the
setting up of small shops on a private basis.
    Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months
against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.
    But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity
figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in
the West, which measures worker output over a given period.
    Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union
as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5
mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period
last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against
194 roubles a year ago.
